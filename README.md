# School Repository - University Coding Lessons Tracker

## Description
Welcome to the **School** repository! This GitHub repository serves as your dedicated space for tracking and organizing your coding lessons during your Computer Science journey at the university. Here, you'll find a structured collection of resources, code samples, and projects related to your coursework and coding assignments.

## Key Features
- **Structured Organization:** The repository is thoughtfully organized into folders and subfolders, each corresponding to different courses, subjects, or coding topics. This structure makes it easy to locate specific materials quickly.

- **Lesson Notes:** Within each course or topic folder, you can maintain detailed notes summarizing key concepts, algorithms, and techniques covered during your lessons. These notes serve as valuable study resources when preparing for exams or reviewing concepts.

- **Code Samples and Projects:** The repository allows you to store code samples and projects associated with each lesson. You can create folders for specific assignments, lab exercises, or personal coding projects. This not only helps you keep track of your coding progress but also showcases your development skills over time.

- **Documentation:** Feel free to add markdown files with documentation for your code, explaining your thought process, design decisions, and any challenges you faced while implementing solutions. This documentation can serve as a reference for your future self and others who might explore your work.

- **Collaboration:** If you're working on group projects or collaborating with classmates, this repository can be a central hub for sharing code, coordinating efforts, and ensuring everyone is on the same page.

- **Version Control:** GitHub's version control capabilities enable you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate seamlessly with peers.

- **Portfolio Building:** As you progress through your studies, you'll accumulate a repository full of code samples, projects, and documentation. This repository can be a valuable addition to your programming portfolio, showcasing your growth as a Computer Science student and aspiring developer.

Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting your coding journey, the **School** repository is designed to help you make the most of your university learning experience. Stay organized, track your progress, and dive into the fascinating world of Computer Science with confidence.

Happy coding!!! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
