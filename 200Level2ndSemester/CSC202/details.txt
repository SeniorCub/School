Running C code in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on a Windows PC involves a few steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install Visual Studio Code:
If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: Visual Studio Code.

Install a C Compiler:
You need a C compiler to compile and run your C code. One popular option for Windows is MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows). Follow these steps to install MinGW:

Download the MinGW installer from the official website: MinGW.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
During installation, make sure to select the option to install the "C Compiler" and any other components you might need.
Install the C/C++ Extension for VSCode:
Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for "C/C++" in the Extensions view search box, and install the one provided by Microsoft.

Configure VSCode for C:
Open your C file or create a new one. If it's a new file, make sure to save it with a ".c" extension.

Configure Build Tasks:
To compile and run your C code, you need to configure build tasks. Create a tasks.json file in the .vscode folder in your project directory. If this folder doesn't exist, you can create it manually. Add the following configuration to tasks.json:

json
Copy code
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build and run",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "gcc",
            "args": [
                "${file}",
                "-o",
                "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
This configuration assumes you have MinGW installed, and it uses the "gcc" compiler.

Compile and Run:
Open your C file, press Ctrl+Shift+B to build and run your program. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the output in the integrated terminal.

That's it! You should now be able to write, compile, and run C code in Visual Studio Code on your Windows PC.
